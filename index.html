    <h1>General Care</h1>
    <p>Here's a few mouse facts right off the bat:
      <ul>
        <li>Their lifespan is 2-3 years</li>
        <li>They grow to 5-7 inches in adulthood</li>
        <li>They are good pets for beginners</li>
      </ul>
      Their short lifespan, small size, and ease of care make them great pets for children and adults alike.
    </p>

    <p>Typically, you will want to keep either a group of females or a single male.  Male mice tend to be aggressive and territorial and may fight with other males.  Females, on the other hand, do well in groups and can be quite social.  Never keep a male with a female, as they are quick to breed.</p>

    <p>Regardless of their sex or how many you have, there are daily and weekly chores you should keep up on.</p>

      <h2>Daily Care:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Clean their food dish</li>
        <li>Provide fresh food and water</li>
        <li>Spot clean any quickly dirtying areas (running wheels, for example, tend to dirty quickly)</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Weekly Care</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Clean their housing</li>
        <li>Change their bedding</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <p>Don’t forget to play with your mouse or mice often, as they are very social animals and can get lonely or bored.</p>
