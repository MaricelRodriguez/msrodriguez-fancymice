    <h1>General Care</h1>
    <p>Here's a few mouse facts right off the bat:
      <ul>
        <li>Their lifespan is 2-3 years</li>
        <li>They grow to 5-7 inches in adulthood</li>
        <li>They are good pets for beginners</li>
      </ul>
      Their short lifespan, small size, and ease of care make them great pets for children and adults alike.
    </p>

    <p>Typically, you will want to keep either a group of females or a single male.  Male mice tend to be aggressive and territorial and may fight with other males.  Females, on the other hand, do well in groups and can be quite social.  <em class="warning">Never keep a male with a female, as they are quick to breed.</em></p>

    <p>Regardless of their sex or how many you have, there are daily and weekly chores you should keep up on.</p>

    <section>
      <h2>Daily Care:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Clean their food dish</li>
        <li>Provide fresh food and water</li>
        <li>Spot clean any quickly dirtying areas (running wheels, for example, tend to dirty quickly)</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Weekly Care</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Clean their housing</li>
        <li>Change their bedding</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <p>Don’t forget to play with your mouse or mice often, as they are very social animals and can get lonely or bored.</p>

  <section id="housing">
    <h1>Housing</h1>
    <p>There are a few housing options to consider: glass tanks, wire cages, or DIY plastic bins.  You can read about the pros and cons of each below. Regardless of which you choose, there are a few things to remember.</p>

    <p>Make sure your mice have plenty of space.  A 10 gallon tank can hold up to 4 mice.</p>

    <p>Have several inches of bedding.  You can use either paper bedding or wood bedding.  Never use pine or cedar, as their particles can cause respiratory issues.  Aspen is a good choice for a wood bedding.</p>

    <p>Soft nesting material should also be provided.  Unscented tissues or soft paper towels work well.</p>

    <p>Keep their habitat away from direct sunlight and out of reach of other pets like cats and dogs.</p>

      </div>

      <h2>Glass Tank</h2>
      <p>You can use either an aquarium tank, or a reptile tank.  Reptile tanks are more expensive, but they open from the front which can make handling easier.</p>

      <p>Pros:
        <ul>
          <li>Easy to clean</li>
          <li>Secure</li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <p>Cons:
        <ul>
          <li>Limited ventilation</li>
          <li>Heavy weight</li>
          <li>Top access only (unless using reptile tank)</li>
          <li>On the expensive side</li>
        </ul>
      </p>

    <section> <!-- wire-cage -->
      <div>
        <img src="images/habitat_wire.jpg" alt="A tall, wire cage with multiple levels."/>
        <span><em>Wire-Top Cage</em> — Jorge Barrios, wikimedia</span>
      </div>

      <h2>Wire Cage</h2>
      <p>If you use a metal cage, such as a bird cage, you need one with small bar spacing.  <em>1/4 inch is the absolute maximum.</em>  Keep in mind that smaller mice, including the young, can escape from bar spacing as little as 1/8 inch.</p>

      <p>You will also need to make sure the cage has a solid bottom and not a grated one.</p>

      <p>Pros:
        <ul>
          <li>Good ventilation</li>
          <li>Light weight</li>
          <li>Bars provide climbing fun</li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <p>Cons:
        <ul>
          <li>Higher chance of escape</li>
          <li>Messier, as bedding is often kicked through the bars</li>
          <li>Difficult to find 1/4 inch or smaller bar spacing</li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      </div>

      <h2>DIY Plastic Bin</h2>
      <p>You can convert a plastic storage bin into a mouse habitat easily.  There are plenty of videos on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=DIY+mouse+cage">YouTube</a> that can teach you how.</p>

      <p>Pros:
        <ul>
          <li>Inexpensive</li>
          <li>Highly customizable</li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <p>Cons:
        <ul>
          <li>Limited ventilation</li>
          <li>Plastic may retain odor</li>
          <li>Takes time and skill to make</li>
        </ul>
